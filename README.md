# GRA-Truist

Welcome to my GRA Truist Repository!

I have created branches for all the team members, so that each member can upload and add their work. 

Additionally there are folders named as per week number. They will contain a README file containing the information about
the work done in that week, alongside the datasets and codes utilised. 

The GRA Truist Spring Sprint Project aims to model the hidden relationships between customers, products, market, 
and risk using graph machine learning and deep learning. It will focus on:

1) Generating synthetic data for customers, products, marketing, and credit/risk based on the data structure and characteristics provided by Truist.

2) Connecting the generated synthetic data using graph databases.

3) Investigating methods to provide a consistent source of information and uncover the relationships between all data points.

4) Visualizing the connections between the data and systems.

5) Comparing storage, speed, and memory requirements with a typical relational database and evaluating the pros and cons of open source vs. enterprise-based graph databases.

6) Adopting container-based development for consistency among students and for a smooth transition to Truist at completion.
