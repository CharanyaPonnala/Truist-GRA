# GRA-Truist

Welcome to my GRA Truist Repository!

I have created branches for all the team members, so that each member can upload and add their work. 

Additionally there are folders named as per week number. They will contain a README file containing the information about
the work done in that week, alongside the datasets and codes utilised.
